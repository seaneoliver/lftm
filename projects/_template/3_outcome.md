# write this after you finish the project and take time to reflect

- What worked well in the project? 
- In hindsight, what would you do differently?
- If you’d had more time, what would you have done?
- If you’d had more budget, what would you have done?
- What data do you have to quantify the results of the project?
- What quotes from stakeholders or users can you include to qualify the project outcome?
