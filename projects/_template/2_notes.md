# capture everything you did so that you can pick and choose the highlights to use in your portfolio, resume, and job interview discussions

update weekly and include the following:

- steps (eg. “Wrote discussion questions for user research interviews to learn more about how…”)
- results (eg. “User research revealed high-level findings of…”)
- challenges (eg. “Multiple meetings to help stakeholders understand research findings.”) 
- impact (eg. “Product roadmap was re-prioritized based on user research findings.”)

As a bonus, here are some pro-tips for writing the project notes. Be intentional about going below the surface. For example, don’t just say “Created prototype of user onboarding for the mobile app.”. Provide a bit more details such as:

- How long you spent creating the prototype?
- Which screens were included?
- What tool did you use?
- What is static or interactive?
- Did you collaborate with anyone on it?
