To-do brain dump
----------------
<!-- 
1. List all the to-do items rattling around in your brain or incomplete from last week's journal
2. Review calendar or notes for things you may not have remembered during initial brain dump
3. Go through whole list and identify
  a. Top priorities
  b. What can safely move to the end of week, next week?
  c. What's just for me (if there's nothing like this in the list, now's the time to add it ðŸ’–)
-->

### Projects
<!-- 
Provide some structure to your brain dump by organizing items into projects/categories.
-->

### Outcomes
<!--
What are the primary *outcomes* you want to accomplish this week? If you're familiar with OKRs, this should be the high-level result, a balance to the list of tasks you just created.
